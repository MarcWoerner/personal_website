# Show your work

-   In order to be good you have to be findable
-   The goal of this book is to bring up an alternative to self-promotion
-   It should teach how to think about work as a never-ending process
-   how to shar this process in a way that attracts people who might be interested and how to deal with the ups and downs of putting oneself and the work in the world

## You dont have to be a genious

-   Dont buy the lone genious myth: An individual with superhuman talents appears out of nowhere free of influences or precedent, with direct connection to god or the muse
    -> good work isnt created in a vacuum and creativity is always in some sense a collaboration, the result of a mind connected to other minds
-   Its about making up an &ldquo;ecology of talent&rdquo;
-   The idea of the scenious - the intelligence and the intuition of a whole cultural scene
-   If we forget about genious and think about how we can contribute to a scenious we can stop asking what others can do for us and start asking what we can do for others
-   &ldquo;Thats all any of us are: amateurs. We dont live long enough to be anything else&rdquo;
-   Amateurs know that contributing anything is better than contributing nothing
-   Thinking about the life defining fact that we all die at some point puts everything in perspective
-   Wayne Coyne: WI realized that I was going to die, and when that gets into your mind&#x2026; it utterly changed me&#x2026; I thought, Im not going to sit here and wait for things to happen, Im going to make them happen, and if people thing Im an idiot I dont care&ldquo;
-   Thinking abour death every morning makes me want to live

## Think Process, not Product

-   For viewers the product matters, for the producing person its all about the process
-   For many the idea of showing the process is a terrifying idea
-   By letting go of our egos and sharing our process, we allow for the possibility of people having an ongoing connection with us and our work - show the process!
-   We are not all astronauts or artists, but we all can find the art in what we are doing
-   How can you show your work even when you have nothing to show?
-   Scoop up the scraps and the residue of your process and shape them into some interesting bit of media that you can share.
    -   Become a documentarian: start a journal, write or record, take a lot of photographs of your work in different stages, shoot videos etc. just document (research, reference, drawings, plans, sketches, interviews, audio, photographs, video, pinboard, journals, drafts, prototypes, demos, diagrams, notes, inspiration, scrapbooks, stories, collections)

## Share something small every day

-   Bobby Solomon - &ldquo;put yourself, and your work, out there everey day, and you&rsquo;ll start meeting some amazing people&rdquo;
-   Everyday there is something to document - do that
    show insights or inspirations, show images of the process etc&#x2026; just document
-   a daily dispatch is better than a resume or portfolio, because it shows what were working on right now
-   It doesnt have to be perfect, but dont post things online that youre not ready for everyone in the world to see - dont overshare
-   Share imperfect and unfinished work you want feedback on, but dont share absolutely everything
-   Time shouldnt be a limiting factor, if you look for it you will find the time
-   But dont let the process of showing your work distract you from work in a way that it takes up too much time
-   &ldquo;Stock and Flow&rdquo; describes that small contributions (Flow) over time, build up to something bigger (stock)
-   A Blog is the ideal machine for turning flow into stock
-   Build your own website

## Open up your cabinet of curiosity

-   Somehow the more your give away the more comes back - dont be a horderer
-   Your influences are worth seeing Where do you get your instpiration?
    What do you read, what do you listen to, which people do you follow, do you look at art?
-   treasure in the trash by nelson molina - pay attention to the stuff that everyone else is ignoring
-   Dont feel guilty, just be authentic, dont try to be hip or cool
-   If you share the work of others, its your duty to make sure that the creators of that work get proper credit
-   Attribution (What is it, who made it and when, why we should care, how you found it, where we can find more things,like it)


<a id="org6ec5c57"></a>

## Tell good Stories

-   Art doesnt speak for itself
-   Human beings want to know ehere ehings came from, how they were made and who made them
-   Ebay example: Joshua Glenn and Rob Walker sold object worth 128$ for 3600$ only by adding a worldclass story in the auction description
-   Humans want to connect, personal stories can make the complex more tangible
    -> spark association and offer entry into things that might otherwise leave one cold
-   If you want to be more effective when sharing yourself and your work, you need to become a better storyteller
-   Emma Coats a former story board artist at Pixar, outlined a basic fast structure:
    &ldquo;Once upon a time, there was\_\_\_\_. Every day, <span class="underline">\_\_</span>. One day,\_\_\_\_. Because of that,\_\_\_\_. Because of that,\_\_\_\_. Until finally,\_\_\_\_\_.&rdquo;
-   Insert here structure of the hero with a thousand faces story structure
-   Find your story, how would you describe it (stick to nonfiction)

## Teach what you know

-   The impulse to keet to yoursef what you have learned is not only shameful, it is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. you open your sage and find ashes - Anni Dillard
-   Take people step by step throught the process
-   Make people better at something they want to be better at


<a id="org499f7f6"></a>

## Dont turn into human spam

-   People who dont want to listen your ideas, they want to tell you theirs
-   acknowledge that good work is always a two-way street, incompleet without feedback
-   If you are only pointing at your own stuff online, youre doing it wrong - be a connector
-   If you want followers, be someone worth following
-   Make stuff you love and talk about stuff you love and youll attract people who love that kind of stuff
-   The Vampire Test - if after hanging out with someone you feel worn out and depleted, that person is a vampire. If after hanging out with someone you still feel full of energy that person is not a vamppire
-   Find people who love the same thing, talk, interact, collaborate, show them work before anyone else
-   When you pin your kind you get your team
-   Meet up with online communities in real life - if there is no gathering - organize one

## Learn to take a punch

-   Fear is often just the imagination taking a wrong turn
-   Strengthen your neck: The more criticism you get, the more you realize it cant hurt you. Therefor you have to put out a lot of work.
-   Roll with the punches: Use the momentum you get from criticism and sometimes its a batch of honor to be hated by a specific group of people
-   Protect your vulnerable areas: Hide work that is too close to you, that you think is too personal to share (dont play that card often)
-   Keep your balance: Work is something you do, its not who you are


<a id="orgf88b4c6"></a>

## Sell out

-   The best sign you can put up is &ldquo;sold out!&rdquo;
-   Dont be jealous whe the people you like do well&#x2026; celebrate their victory as if its youe own
-   Dont be the bitter dude who stops consuming art from an artist he likes because he gets known and has success
-   When a audience is grown, put a little virtual tip jar or donation button on the website
-   Be ambitious. Keep yourself busy. Think bigger. Expand your audience.


<a id="org17c72a3"></a>

## Stick around

-   Keep working on things, build up consitancy
-   But dont be scared to take a break and gain distance to get back to work, it takes time to come up with new thoughts and ideas
-   Its not about starting over but about beginning again
-   There is no such thing as finished work, there is only abandoned work
