# Show your work!

-   **In order to be good you have to be findable** - this book explores viewing work as an ongoing process, sharing it to attract the right audience, and navigating the challenges of putting yourself and your work out into the world.

## Chapter 1: You dont have to be a genious

-   **Reject the "lone genius" myth** — creativity doesn’t happen in isolation.
-   **Focus on a creative ecosystem** where talent thrives collectively.
-   **Embrace "scenious"** — the shared intelligence of a cultural scene.
-   **Shift perspective** from what you can gain to what you can contribute.
-   **Everyone is an amateur** — and that’s okay! Making and sharing is what matters.

## Chapter 2: Think Process, not Product

-   **Product vs. Process** – Viewers care about the final product, but creators should embrace the process.
-   **Fear of sharing** – Many hesitate to reveal their creative journey, but doing so builds connection.
-   **Let go of ego** – Sharing your process fosters engagement and relationships with your audience.
-   **Creativity is everywhere** – You don’t have to be an artist; find the art in what you do.
-   **Show your work, even when it feels like you have nothing** – Capture and share the scraps of your process.
-   **Become a documentarian:** Start a journal, write or record, take a lot of photographs of your work in different stages, shoot videos etc. just document (research, reference, drawings, plans, sketches, interviews, audio, photographs, video, pinboard, journals, drafts, prototypes, demos, diagrams, notes, inspiration, scrapbooks, stories, collections)

## Chapter 3: Share something small every day

- **Put yourself out there** – Share your work daily, and you'll connect with amazing people.  
- **Document every day** – There’s always something to capture, whether it’s insights, inspirations, or process images.  
- **Daily updates > Resumes** – A consistent stream of work shows what you're actively creating.  
- **Balance sharing and creating** – Don’t let documenting overshadow the actual work.  
- **Stock & Flow** – Small, frequent contributions (Flow) accumulate into something lasting (Stock).  
- **Own your platform** – Build your own website to have full control over your work and how it’s presented.

## Chapter 4: Open up your cabinet of curiosity

- **The more you give, the more comes back** – Don’t hoard your work; sharing leads to unexpected returns.  
- **Your influences matter** – Show where you get your inspiration: what you read, listen to, watch, and follow.  
- **Find treasure in the overlooked** – Like Nelson Molina’s *Treasure in the Trash*, pay attention to what others ignore.  
- **Be authentic** – Don’t try to be trendy; just be yourself.  
- **Credit matters** – If you share someone else’s work, always give proper attribution.  
- **Attribution guide** – When sharing, include:  
  - *What* it is  
  - *Who* made it and *when*  
  - *Why* it matters  
  - *How* you found it  
  - *Where* to find more like it

## Chapter 5: Tell good Stories

- **Art doesn’t speak for itself** – People want to know where things come from, how they were made, and who made them.  
- **Humans crave connection** – Personal stories make complex ideas more relatable, sparking associations and providing entry points into new concepts.  
- **Storytelling is key** – To share your work effectively, become a better storyteller.  
- **Emma Coats’ Pixar story structure:**  
  - *Once upon a time, there was \_\_\_\_. Every day, \_\_\_\_. One day, \_\_\_\_. Because of that, \_\_\_\_. Because of that, \_\_\_\_. Until finally, \_\_\_\_.*

## Chapter 6: Teach what you know

- **Sharing knowledge is essential** – Keeping what you’ve learned to yourself is not only shameful but destructive. *“Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes.”* – Annie Dillard  
- **Teach by showing the process** – Guide people step by step through how you create, learn, or solve problems.  
- **Help others improve** – Focus on making people better at something they want to get better at.

## Chapter 7: Dont turn into human spam

- **People don’t want to listen to your ideas; they want to share theirs** – Engage in conversations, not just self-promotion.  
- **Good work needs feedback** – Creation is a two-way street; interaction makes it complete.  
- **Be a connector, not just a promoter** – If you only share your own work, you're missing the point.  
- **Be worth following** – Create and talk about things you genuinely love, and you’ll attract like-minded people.  
- **The Vampire Test** – If someone drains your energy, they’re a vampire. If they inspire and energize you, they’re not.  
- **Find your people** – Connect, collaborate, and share ideas with those who love the same things as you.  
- **Pin your kind, build your team** – When you find your people, you create your support network.  
- **Meet online communities in real life** – If no gathering exists, take the initiative to organize one.

## Chapter 8: Learn to take a punch

- **Fear is just imagination taking a wrong turn** – Don’t let it hold you back.  
- **Strengthen your neck** – The more criticism you get, the less it can hurt you. Keep putting out work.  
- **Roll with the punches** – Use criticism as momentum. Sometimes, being disliked by a certain group is a badge of honor.  
- **Protect your vulnerable areas** – Keep personal work private if it feels too close to share (but don’t overuse this).  
- **Keep your balance** – Your work is something you do, not who you are.

## Chapter 9: Sell out

- **The best sign you can put up is "Sold Out!"** – Success means demand exceeds supply.  
- **Celebrate others' success** – Don't be jealous when people you admire do well. Their victory is your victory too.  
- **Avoid bitterness** – Don't stop enjoying an artist’s work just because they become successful.  
- **Monetize when the time is right** – Once you have an audience, consider adding a virtual tip jar or donation button.  
- **Stay ambitious** – Keep busy, think bigger, and expand your reach.

## Chapter 10: Stick around

- **Keep working consistently** – Progress is built over time through steady effort.  
- **Take breaks when needed** – Distance helps refresh your mind and generate new ideas.  
- **It's not about starting over, but beginning again** – Every return is a new phase of growth.  
- **Work is never truly finished** – It is only abandoned when you decide to move on.
