Last year, on a typical summer day in the south of Germany, my last exam of the semester was done, and I finally felt that surge of vitality return again. In the afternoon, I met up with friends at a nearby student-run bar. With a DJ spinning tracks and plenty of beer flowing, the night flew by. The next morning, plagued by a well-deserved hangover, I squinted against the sunlight and ennoyed by the noisy traffic, I remembered the awkward conversations I had stumbled through the night before. While lying in bed, I got an email… “we would like to welcome you as an intern at our research institution”!

The institution where I planned to begin my internship was in Vienna, and I set myself the challenge of cycling there. So, I pedalled my way to Vienna, and it was an amazing experience. By that point, I had already refrained from alcohol for roughly three weeks, which felt pretty good. Upon arriving in Vienna, I found myself embracing this alcohol-free lifestyle. I made the decision to tell newly met people that I was taking a break from alcohol and kept on walking the alc-free pathway.

So far the new Vienna life was great. I enjoyed the culture, I went to traditional restaurants and was finally at a place where sweet dishes are accepted as a main course! But as always, a shared “Kaiserschmarren” is a better “Kaiserschmarren.” So at some point, I wanted to meet new people. Luckily, i got invited to a houseparty through my flatmates. As we went there, I quickly realised that I got socially somewhat stuck. What I mean with that, is that It felt difficult to connect to people at parties without the ease a Beer usually provides. Conversations felt awkward in a way that I somehow was looking at myself from outside and decided that what i was telling wouldn’t be worth saying nor interesting. To break it down, I was experiencing social insecurities. I never perceived them actively because usually at some point those insecurities would have been washed away in the flow of the evening.

The next day I was both, concerned and happy at the same time.
Concerned because I had to confront the reality that in my culture and life, alcohol was often used to turn off insecurity in social interaction. And yet, I was also happy because I could now explore that feeling and experience it freely. At first it sounds strange to be happy to realise that one is experiencing negative emotions. But it did not appear as a problem to me, it felt more like a underdeveloped skill i could improve on. It was like the start of a game where its all about getting better in these social interactions. From that moment on, an evening with alcohol felt like a missed opportunity to practice the social skill.

Alcohol could be seen as a doping that brings you to a point where you don’t feel anxious or nervous anymore, but it also hinders from going further or deeper into conversations and interactions. Alcohol opens you up in a way that you talk and stop self-criticizing. But I think that it prevents you from going into deep and truly valuable conversations. It consumes a significant part of your capacity to listen and let words really sit. One could say, that alcohol opens your mouth but not your heart.

So what did I do? I started training the social skill. From day to day it got better. I searched for opportunities to go out and speak to people. To be honest it wasn’t easy. That inner critic got a pretty strong and loud voice. Especially when I joined preexisting groups where I was the only new person it was hard to find into conversations without getting interrupted by the inner critic. But over time that got better too.

For me as a person who often struggled with these social interactions, I am happy about that realisation. Im far away from mastery. But what i want, is to walk the path of mastering doping free, to eventually reach that field of social and personal growth where we find into the flow of great and valuable conversations.

I want to encourage you to play only one round of the social game doping free.
