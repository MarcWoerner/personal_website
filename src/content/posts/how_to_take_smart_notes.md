# Taking Smart Notes

While looking at my well-structured codebase on the right and a blank page on the left, one sentence from my supervisor echoed in my head: "The written pages are what counts." At the time, I was a Data Science student working on my Bachelor’s thesis. I ran into pretty much every challenge people warn you about when you're starting such an academic project.

I wrote code believing that the lines in my text editor would sufficiently document my thought process. But as time revealed its relativity and the end of the working period loomed—with only about two weeks left—things became challenging. The main issue was that while my code documented the steps I had taken, it reflected results rather than ideas. The underlying thoughts were missing.

It turned out to be highly inefficient to work backward from the final results, trying to reconstruct the ideas in a top-down manner in order to build a logically coherent structure.

While learning this the hard way I started thinking about notetaking and how an efficient notetaking workaround would look like which brought me (one week before deadline) to the book "How to Take Smart Notes" from Sönke Ahrens. 

The author makes it clear from the beginning that academic or non-fiction writing needs a solid structure:

> “A good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on the important.”  
> — *Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes*

I really like the quote because I can relate to it through other areas of my life. For instance, using a calendar to structure my daily routine feels completely natural to me — I always know what happens when. As a result, I never get the feeling that I may have forgotten something or left something unfinished. The same logic applies to writing: once you’ve established a clear structure, you can shift your focus to the more important and creative part — generating ideas.

The core concept underpinning the book is the Slipbox System developed by Niklas Luhmann. This method addresses the common problem of disorganized writing processes, shifting the focus away from producing a single academic product to instead cultivating a system of interconnected thoughts. Within this system, ideas are developed and refined organically through consistent note-taking, ultimately leading to the creation of structured arguments for papers or theses.

At the heart of the Slipbox System lies a clear distinction between different types of notes that support the research and writing process:

## Different Note Types

1) **Fleeting Notes** – Quick, rough notes capturing spontaneous thoughts or interesting points from readings. These are temporary and meant to be processed soon after being taken.
2) **Literature Notes** – These are more structured, taken while reading a source. They focus on capturing what the author is saying, typically in your own words, and include bibliographic details.
3) **Permanent Notes** – These are the core of the Slipbox. Carefully written in your own words, they reflect your understanding, insights, and connections to other ideas. Each note is self-contained, clear, and can stand alone in the system.
The power of the Slipbox lies in how these permanent notes are linked to one another, forming a web of knowledge that encourages non-linear thinking, creativity, and a more efficient writing process. Instead of starting from scratch each time, the writer builds upon a living archive of ideas that grows over time.

## The Process

The Slipbox System follows a clear, iterative workflow designed to foster deep understanding and long-term knowledge creation:

1) **Read**
Engage with books, articles, and other sources. As you read, take fleeting notes—brief reminders of key ideas—and create literature notes summarizing the content in your own words, along with source references.
2) **Write**
From your fleeting and literature notes, distill permanent notes. These are written clearly and precisely, containing your own thoughts, interpretations, and connections. Each note should represent one idea and be understandable on its own.
3) **Connect**
Link permanent notes to related ones using their unique identifiers (IDs). This creates a network of ideas rather than a hierarchical or linear structure. Connections form naturally as you build on existing thoughts.
4) **Review**
Regularly revisit your notes to deepen understanding, generate new insights, and identify patterns or gaps. The Slipbox becomes an active partner in your thinking and writing process, helping you develop ideas organically.

## Conclusion

So, how did it work out for me in the end?

To be honest, I didn't apply the insights from the book during the stressful final phase of my thesis. But now, after using the strategy for a few months since submitting, I’m standing at the starting gate of my Master's degree — and I genuinely can’t wait to further develop my network of ideas, thoughts, facts, and notes. 

This time, I’m not just writing — I’m thinking with a system. And that changes everything.

**Here’s a challenge for you to finish this post with:**  
Try starting with just **three notes a day**, following the Slipbox System, for one week. That's it — just three. Take fleeting notes, distill them into permanent notes, and connect them.

You might be surprised how this growing network will sharpen your thinking, fuel your creativity, and give structure to your ideas in a way that no traditional method ever could.
